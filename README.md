### Description

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

This repository provides a simple library to calculate Fibonacci numbers up to a given limit. It allows you to compute various characteristics like highest prime factor, parity, and more.

### Features

*   Quickly calculates Fibonacci numbers
<!--*   Computes the greatest prime factor of a number in O(n log n)
*   Calculates the parity (odd/even) of every value
*   Supports calculating up to 99 elements-->
*   Written in clean, modular, easy-to-understand code
